# PhysiCell POV-writer

This is an adaptation of Paul Macklin's 3-D cancer immune visualizations.

This will process a series of PhysiCell digital snapshots to create POV files for raytracing.

Note that users will then need to run POV-Ray on the .pov files, and potentially annotate them (e.g., with ImageMagick) and stitch them together into a movie (e.g., via mencocder).
